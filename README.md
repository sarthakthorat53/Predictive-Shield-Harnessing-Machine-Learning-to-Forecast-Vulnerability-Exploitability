# Predictive-Shield-Harnessing-Machine-Learning-to-Forecast-Vulnerability-Exploitability
This project uses machine learning to predict software vulnerability exploitability by analyzing CVE data. It processes NVD data, identifies key CVSS metrics, and uses them as model inputs to predict CVSS scores. The goal is to provide actionable insights for proactive remediation and stronger cybersecurity defenses.
